{"title": "Bright Spot: St. Thomas-Elgin reduces chronic homelessness by 30% in just seven months", "url": "https://caeh.ca/bright-spot-st-thomas/", "content": "Community collaboration is a key component to the community’s recent successA collaborative approach has led to a major reduction in chronic homelessness in St. Thomas-Elgin, a community of roughly 100,000 people in southwestern Ontario.  Between July 2023 and January 2024, St. Thomas-Elgin reduced chronic homelessness by 30%.  Working together over that time, the community found homes for 126 people experiencing homelessness, more than half of whom were grappling with chronic homelessness. Roughly one quarter of those people experiencing homelessness — 31 people — were housed in November 2023 alone! The reduction is a direct result of the local service providers from multiple sectors coming together to create community-wide solutions, according to the St. Thomas Elgin BFZ-C team.  “Resiliency, hope and community collaboration are critical to this work,” said Danielle Neilson, Manager of Housing Stability Services with the St. Thomas-Elgin Social Services Department.    Reducing homelessness takes continuous effort  Across the country there has been an increase in people experiencing homelessness, including in St. Thomas-Elgin.   Reducing and ending homelessness is not a linear pathway. St. Thomas-Elgin established quality By-Name Data in September 2021 and celebrated its first reduction of 25% in August 2022. But soon after, homelessness increased.  Some of this increase was due to a surge in new homelessness, but much was also due to local data and process improvements. Improvements included expanding access points and mapping, while increasing outreach efforts to people living unsheltered or at risk of homelessness. As a result, the community reset their baseline to 120 people experiencing chronic homelessness in July 2023.  Community partners responded to this increase by further coordinating and expanding program and service efforts. By August 2023, the community was able to start making reductions again. By January 2024, St. Thomas-Elgin had reduced homelessness by 30%  The power of a community coming together with a housing focused approach A major factor that contributed to reductions in St. Thomas-Elgin included new supportive housing. In September of 2023, St. Thomas welcomed, The Station, a brand new 45-unit housing project for people experiencing chronic homelessness with mid-acuity, led by developer Indwell, St. Thomas-Elgin’s newest supportive housing provider and partner. The Station is the second Indwell build for the municipality, preceded by Railway City Lofts, which is 15 units of highly supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness with the highest acuity.     This new supportive housing through Indwell accounted for many of the community’s move-ins, but not all. People were also assisted to move into other supportive, affordable and market rent housing opportunities through YWCA St. Thomas-Elgin, St. Thomas-Elgin Social Services and the Canadian Mental Health Association Thames Valley who stepped up their own efforts to find homes for people experiencing homelessness in St. Thomas-Elgin.  Additionally, The INN, their local emergency shelter, has worked hard to become low-barrier and housing focused and the YWCA St. Thomas-Elgin, implemented A Place Called Home, a program to support women-led families facing housing instability in the community.  Health and Justice Sector Partnerships Services and supports that have been making an impact include a low-barrier Sublocade harm reduction program provided to more than 150 people experiencing homelessness and those transitioning into housing.  The Sublocade program began operating through the Central Community Health Centre (CCHC) in St. Thomas in 2022. It includes regular meetings and monthly injections (rather than daily doses) and does not require people to abstain from street drugs. Since implementing this program, it has resulted in zero overdoses and a reduction of street drug use over time. Strong physician-patient relationships have also been built, resulting in improved mental and physical health, and engagement in other health and housing programs resulting in more people being housed and less people returning to homelessness.  In addition, the St. Thomas Police Service (STPS) has observed that there has been a reduction in police interventions on the streets and at the shelter. They have connected this reduction to the Sublocade harm reduction program, as well as the effort that the STPS has made to build positive relationships with vulnerable people, including people experiencing homelessness.  In 2022, the STPS launched a new program, the Community Resource Team, within downtown St. Thomas. This team fosters relationships and works with community partners to enhance services for vulnerable people, including people impacted by mental health, substance use, homelessness, and poverty.   The Community Resource Team has focused on helping people to connect or maintain connection with housing and health resources to avoid unnecessary involvement in the justice systems or the loss of housing.  These programs led by the STPS and CCHC are examples of how other sectors, including the health and justice sector, are needed in local solutions and responses to reducing homelessness. These sectors working together with the housing and homelessness sector directly contributed to the 30% chronic homelessness reduction in St. Thomas-Elgin.  Next steps Despite all these efforts, the St. Thomas-Elgin team is not resting on its laurels. They know their work isn’t done in reducing homelessness.  But what they have accomplished so far can be a template for other cities looking to replicate their success.  “We are seeing sectors come together and we are leaning into sector-known best practices, and it is working.  We still have lots of work ahead of us, but we are seeing success. We are implementing these best practices and continually improving, and we are doing it in collaboration – together, at the same time. If we can do it, so can other communities,” said Heather Sheridan, Director of Social Services. "},
{"title": "Bright Spot: The Thompson Model of Lived Experience Leadership", "url": "https://caeh.ca/bright-spot-the-thompson-model-of-lived-experience-leadership/", "content": "That is the question at the heart of a revolutionary leadership and governance model that has been developed in the northern community of Thompson, Manitoba.  The traditional approach to developing Coordinated Access Systems is to establish a Community Advisory Board (CAB). The CAB makes policy and strategic decisions that set up, oversee, and monitor the Coordinated Access System — but there’s no requirement to include the leadership of people with lived and living experience of homelessness. In some communities in more recent years, CABs have established advisory groups of People with Lived Experience (PWLE). In some communities they make suggestions or in others, they have decisions run past them for their advice. In almost all cases, these bodies don’t have any actual decision-making force — their advice is just that: advice.  Unfortunately, this can quickly become a check box for ‘inclusion’ and become tokenism, even if PWLE are a component in a governance group. In Thompson, a small group of passionate individuals were asked to create a Coordinated Access System. Very early on they asked the question, “what if we put the people we are serving in charge?”  This was scary. It hadn’t been done before.  They had all kinds of questions, many based in stigma about people experiencing homelessness: What if they can’t handle it? What if mental health or substance use barriers mean that they destabilize and become erratic? What if they make decisions we don’t like? Are we even allowed to do this? But they saw the opportunity to pioneer a model that put those impacted by the CAB’s decisions in charge. The Lived Experience Circle (LEC) was created, and the Thompson Model was born. “One of the most important things about being part of the Lived-Experience Circle is coming to meetings and sharing what I hear from people on the street—too often projects are done without talking to people on the street,” said Jack Robinson, LEC member. The Thompson LEC share a meal together after a meeting, joined by CAEH staff members, Quinn Moerike and Jody Yurkowsky Pace.With The Thompson Model, the LEC meets regularly to discuss any of the issues requiring attention.  All interest holders within the community — including governments, the community entity, service providers, content experts, etc. — are invited to that meeting. The information required for a decision is presented, and everyone present can ask questions, gain additional information, provide context, and have a fulsome discussion of the issue at hand. But importantly, no decision is voted on here.  Once this is done, everyone but the LEC is dismissed. The LEC then eats a meal together. Once the meal is completed and both mind and body have had a chance to digest, the serious discussion and decision-making begins. They vote on the pertinent items, and their decision is final. That decision is then communicated to all the organizations impacted.  It really is that simple.  They break bread together and make a decision, after having access to everyone who has pertinent information or expertise. Importantly, no one outside the LEC votes on or decides these issues. Everyone else exists to provide expertise and advice. It’s a complete reversal of the status quo and empowering for people experiencing homelessness. In addition, all members of the LEC are supported by a full-time support worker who acts as a liaison between them and the interested parties, coordinates their work, arranges for transportation, and is meant to remove any barriers to the LEC being able to effectively do their work that they can. The LEC are provided with laptops with software pre-loaded that allows them to access any of the files that they need, communicate with each other, and do any of the preparations that any board member would be required to do. Transportation to and from meetings is provided, as well as the meal that they share, and most critically – they are paid.  Payment was one of the things that was controversial when The Thompson Model was in the early stages. It was pointed out that most board members are not paid. However, others differed, saying that while that is technically true, it is not absolutely true. On many other boards, most or all the people attending meetings and doing the work were doing that as an extension of their professional roles within the community, and so their salaries were effectively paying them to do that work.  “When I come to LEC meetings, it always makes me want to do more to end homelessness. I look forward to these meetings and being part of finding solutions,” says Douglas Hart, LEC member. LEC members are also provided significant opportunities for training. They have been given access to OCAP Training, some training in computer skills, Coordinated Access training, and ongoing support in understanding funding applications, policy documents, and other issues they consider.  Two things were spoken about very early on. The LEC members had to be fairly stable, and they had to reflect the demographics of people experiencing homelessness in their community.  On the first point, it was felt strongly that, while they were open to people currently experiencing homelessness serving on the LEC, the complex and sometimes demanding work required members to not be constantly worried about where they were sleeping or showering that day, or where their next meal was coming from. It was felt that it was unlikely that someone currently in crisis — sleeping rough or in complete survival mode — could have the bandwidth to meaningfully contribute.  On the second, because Thompson’s homeless population is at least ~90% Indigenous, this group had to look like the community to reflect what was happening in the community. Guided by Dr. Jessie Thistle’s foundational work on Indigenous Definitions of Homelessness, the LEC has reflected the demographics of their community ever since the beginning. “It is empowering being part of the Lived-Experience Circle because I know what it is like to be homeless. There is a solution to ending homelessness and it takes humility, caring, and respect for all people,” added Leo Moose, LEC member. It has been an amazing success. Beyond all expectations.  The LEC has reviewed, developed, changed, edited, and implemented an entire policy manual for Coordinated Access in their community. During a recent RFP, they reviewed the funding applications, made the funding decisions, and asked for changes to the applications, requesting that only the aspects that they agreed to were part of any ongoing funding decisions. They travelled to the 2023 National Conference on Ending Homelessness in Halifax where they presented on The Thompson Model. And they continue to do the work, undaunted by its complexity and importance.  One of the concerns voiced at the beginning was that attendance at these meetings would be an issue. Some who had experience working with people with lived experience of homelessness who hold advisory positions mentioned that they had trouble getting them to attend the meetings.   In the main, that has not been borne out.  Attendance is better than most boards that the community interest holders have been involved with.  The LEC is invested. This is their system, they are given the tools to participate that traditional board members would already have access to, such as computers, payment, food, and transportation, and they see that the decisions they make are not ignored but implemented. They joined to create change, and that is exactly what they are doing. “I’ve learned a lot by being here with this group and I would like to do more to help the people out there. It’s a great group and I enjoy meeting new people,” said Delores Cook, LEC member. This work is truly revolutionary. The power dynamics have been upended and the members of the LEC are doing complex and impactful work. The Mayor, City Manager, and all of the stakeholders in the community have completely bought in and are committed to this process.  The fears that this would end in disaster were, of course, unfounded.  The LEC continues its work, and continues to lead the community. Now, any changes or adaptations of the initial idea are for the LEC to decide.  And decide they will.  Nothing about us, without us.Written by Quinn Moerike, National Training Consultant at Training and Technical Assistance."},
{"title": "“Homelessness is a housing problem”: CAEH addresses HUMA Committee", "url": "https://caeh.ca/homelessness-huma-committee/", "content": "The House of Commons Committee on Human Resources, Skills, Social Development, and Persons with Disabilities (HUMA) has undertaken a study to understand how past underinvestment in housing has contributed to the current housing and homelessness crisis. The Committee has heard from witnesses from across the housing sector, including Tim Richter, CEO of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.On June 10th, Tim appeared as a witness at the Committee, and shared some key reflections on how we found ourselves in the current housing and homelessness crisis and the solutions government can implement to reverse course:Homelessness is a housing affordability problem, driven by high rent and low vacancy. The surge of homelessness and encampments we’re seeing today is the result of the cost-of-living crisis.Think about a game of musical chairs with 10 kids around 10 chairs. There is one kid in the game, Alice, who has a broken ankle. The music starts, a chair gets taken away, and when it is time to sit down, everyone gets a chair but Alice. When we ask her, “why aren’t you in a chair?” she responds, “it is because I have a broken ankle and couldn’t get to a chair fast enough.” But the reason Alice isn’t in a chair is because there aren’t enough for everyone, not because of her broken ankle. This can help us to understand the impacts of the lack of affordable housing on homelessness – when rents skyrocket and the availability of units decreases, low-income households or people with other needs, end up forced out of their homes and simply can’t compete when there are not enough affordable housing options, or chairs when the music stops. Mass homelessness like we know it today hasn’t always existed. The roots of our current homelessness crisis and the surge in encampments are tied to the roots of our housing crisis. That began in 1980 with the federal withdrawal from incentives to support rental housing constructions and subsequent reduction in affordable, social, and co-op housing investments and the elimination of federal affordable housing programs in 1995. This is a problem that is over 40 years in the making.If we want to solve homelessness, we need to ensure we have a healthy housing system – a system where there is affordability and choice, from social housing to ownership. The whole system has to be healthy. If the ownership system isn’t working, people stay in rental housing. If the rental system isn’t balanced, the burden falls on non-market housing, and people are pushed out the bottom of the system. To resolve this, we need a clear federal strategy to eliminate homelessness and importantly, as highlighted by the Auditor General, we need to connect the housing strategy with the homelessness strategy and objectives.We must take an approach rooted in cooperative federalism. Solving homelessness requires a national strategy with an approach similar to disaster response, where there is a plan and an agreement between different levels of government on who does what within their different jurisdictions. Imagine a natural disaster – the local government and community lead and the provincial and federal governments come and support. This approach is key to ending homelessness.The federal government’s return to housing leadership with the National Housing Strategy and the new Housing Plan are welcome. This plan should be successful, if implemented well, in expanding rental and non-market housing construction over time. However, there is an absence of federal-provincial-territorial coordination and collaboration. You can implement measures like the GST reduction or accelerated capital cost allowance, but if development charges eat up those new savings, we are no further ahead.There are some clear recommendations for the federal government and Committee on Human Resources, Skills, Social Development, and Persons with Disabilities to consider as they move forward:While the current housing and homelessness crises have been decades in the making, now it is time for all levels of government to remedy the past and turn their attention to the solutions."},

{"title": "Compassionate decampment: lessons from Oppenheimer Park", "url": "https://caeh.ca/compassionate-decampment-blog/", "content": "The CAEH is developing a series of stories highlighting successful encampment resolutions that are people-centered and housing-focused, without using enforcement as the primary approach. Read the first blog in this series highlighting Fort McMurray, Alberta.by Nadia Moharib  Behind the encampment tarps and tents are communities comprised mostly of people trying to survive another day. And in the midst of all the political ping-pong on how to address the shameful illustrations of a housing crisis scattered across the country, camp residents are rarely part of the conversation. \n \nInstead, they are often brutally silenced when kicked out of encampments with or without affordable and appropriate housing lined up.  \n \nStephanie Allen calls it “dehumanizing” and avoidable. \n \n“I think encampments demonstrate the failures of the system. They are a symptom of a deeper problem. It’s absolutely a housing problem. We can’t take the focus off of it being a housing solution,” she says. “I’m sickened by it. I want to go to every city doing this and say you can do this better.” \n \nAllen did just that.  A drone photo of the Oppenheimer Park encampment.In 2019, as BC Housing’s newly minted vice-president of strategic operations, she was tasked with shuttering Vancouver’s Oppenheimer Park tent city, again. \n \nShe walked into the job in early August just after the City of Vancouver had cleared the encampment leaving outrage and anger over how it was done. There was backlash for the traumatizing, enforcement-heavy approach and lack of a bonafide connection to housing options for those ruthlessly relocated. \n \nAnd it didn’t work.  \n \nWithout fences, many simply moved back onto the site and others set up camp there — lured by the prospect of somewhere to stay albeit unacceptable and dangerous with the constant threat of predators who moved about in the midst of it all.  \n \nWithin weeks of the city’s decampment, Allen began conversations with Oppenheimer Park residents and advocates eager to vent, a fraught yet meaningful process that would span about nine months. She learned that housed amid the tents and tired souls at the Downtown Eastside site, lived a community of people struggling with their own issues and a shared desperation.  Encampments are not a solution to homelessness but a tragic survival mechanism many resort to given a lack of affordable housing options. That said, every time one is taken down it means not only removing what some call a neighbourhood eyesore but ripping apart a community. \n \n“I didn’t know encampments were an entire ecosystem of people surviving and taking care of each other,” Allen says.  \n \nCritics of the prior Oppenheimer decamping cited trauma and stress created by not only the enforcement-style approach but lack of engagement with those impacted. Allen didn’t want to repeat that mistake.  \n \nInstead of simply relocating people, she and her team decided that the voices of those being relocated would be part of the careful planning and execution. They would forgo the all-too-familiar heavy-handed approach, opting for a compassionate and respectful one instead. She gave those living at Oppenheimer her word that, on behalf of B.C. Housing, they would work with them every step of the way. \n \n“And I apologized,” Allen says. “That was my starting point.”With Park Board representatives, they held regular meetings with residents, gathering in an overdose tent and other times seeking direction from leaders like the late Chrissy Brett, an Indigenous advocate for human rights for unhoused people. They offered coffee, breakfast, and an invitation to talk.  \n \nAnd they listened. \n \n“That was a completely new thing, to have executives and senior management people sitting down in an encampment to listen to the needs of people on the ground,” Allen says. “We wanted to take a harm-reduction approach to moving people indoors.”  \n \nOutreach workers and peer supporters, including some who were once homeless and many from Indigenous groups, were recruited as part of a compassionate but urgent decampment strategy.  \n \nTheir task was to build relationships to help people move up into stable housing when they moved out of the park. Housing meant something different for each individual and it was key to know what that was. It was also crucial to ensure people were not just relocated but connected to affordable, appropriate housing rather than hustled into shelters.  \n \nA pet-friendly place for a man toughing it out in a tent with his dog while he underwent cancer treatment. Something decent for the guy with bed bug bites along his neck after living in a single-room occupancy and a little understanding for someone refusing housing because they feared having a real address would mean credit card companies would track them down to recoup debts. Courtesy of Patrick Pouponneau.\nPatrick Pouponneau, a B.C.-based outreach worker and operational lead, made a detailed map of where people’s tents were located and a list of needs so they could be matched with suitable housing. Ensuring everyone was “appropriately housed” was the right thing to do and would also lessen the chances they would be forced back to a camp to flee sketchy lodgings with predatory neighbours. \n \nPouponneau says it was all a dignified departure from decampments which often are done with no communication, little warning, aggression from authorities, and not much in the way of new beginnings. \n \n“Imagine someone just kicks in your door and pulls you out of your house and maybe, if you’re lucky, gives you a piece of paper with a phone number for resources that don’t exist,” he says. “Folks have no say. We are essentially warehousing human beings.” \n \nAllen says the commonly-repeated “decampments to nowhere” means people don’t get connected with housing, which is a fundamental right. People need a plan not punishment and success hinges on offering affordable housing, says Allen who is now a housing and community development consultant. \n \n“We housed a guy from Oppenheimer who had been living in a shelter for five years,” she says. “The only mental health issue he had was depression and anxiety from being homeless. He was simply poor, alone, and homeless. It was life-changing. He made friends again, got a job and it stabilized his life.” \n \nPouponneau says many opt for an encampment as a last resort rather than a choice. \n \n“Listen, I’ve worked in encampments in Victoria, Nanaimo, and multiple in Vancouver,” he says. “Nobody. Nobody. Nobody chooses to be in an encampment. That is for them the safest most appropriate ‘option.’”  \n \nAppropriate housing, not a campsite, offers the best starting point for those rebuilding their lives. \n \n“If I’m, say, an urban Indigenous person and I am going into treatment to unearth this incredible trauma, am I supposed to go to a bunk bed infested with bugs and work through that?” he asks. “If I’m a schizophrenic trying to rework my mind, am I supposed to do that in a tent?” \n \nBy April 2020, a provincial order as part of the province’s response to the COVID-19 crisis, mandated the clearing of encampments. A May 9th deadline added urgency to the process. \n \nAbout 300 people were relocated from Oppenheimer to supportive housing over a nine-day period. Six months later, upwards of 80 per cent were still there. \n \nUnlike many decampments across the country, it was cooperative and mostly protest-free — cognizant of how traumatizing the process can be when it isn’t approached with compassion, not only for residents but those tasked with removing often distraught fellow human beings from the only home they have. \n \n“We are dehumanizing people who are homeless to such a degree that anger and violence is now justified to be used against people who are poor,” Allen says. “It’s a very difficult thing to witness that level of human suffering and it doesn’t have to happen.” \n \n“Everyone involved becomes traumatized. All of us, the people who have to walk by people in sleeping bags to get coffee, people in decision-making positions, elected officials, workers doing front-line services…it is systemic dehumanization,” she adds. “We are kind of thrust into it because we are letting the system off the hook for providing safe, affordable, accessible housing.” \n \nPouponneau says the Oppenheimer experience was difficult but worked for many reasons, key being collaboration between residents and those tasked with decamping. \n \nTogether they shared a vision for something better, something which can be nearly impossible to do when you live in a tent fixated on day-to-day survival and the threat of losing what little you have to authorities who show up unannounced. \n \n“Survival is very myopic,” he says. \n \nHe says the mere visibility of encampments, seen by many as nothing but ugly and unwelcome, offers an important and necessary commentary. \n \n “They shouldn’t exist but they serve a purpose. If you have an encampment in your community, you’re gonna notice,” he says. “There is a way out of this. That’s when we all get together and really act like housing is a human right. It’s not just a homeless problem, it’s a Canadian problem and it all comes down to housing.” If you’d like to share a story of a positive encampment resolution that got people into housing, please email info@caeh.ca and share your story."},

Chrystia Freeland, will deliver the federal government’s budget in exactly four weeks. At a time when many Canadians are grappling with the growing housing crisis and affordability pressures, the authors of the National Housing Accord – the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, REALPAC, and the PLACE Centre at the Smart Prosperity Institute – are calling for a federal budget focused on housing.  “Budget 2024 presents a critical opportunity for the federal government to address the immediate challenges faced by those experiencing and at-risk of homelessness, while building the long-term solutions needed to solve the housing crisis affecting Canadians in communities across the country,” said Michael Brooks, Chief Executive Officer, REALPAC. This budget comes at a time when many Canadians are worried about where their next rent or mortgage cheque will come from, and a wave of new homelessness is accelerating across the country – the government must respond. This budget will meet the moment if it passes these four tests: “Solving the housing and homelessness crises is possible if the government responds with the urgency and ambition required,” said Tim Richter, President & CEO of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. “Since 2019, homelessness has risen every year in Canada, and we urgently need a coordinated national strategy and federal resources to end homelessness.” The federal government can reverse the trends and have an immediate impact on homelessness by using this budget as an opportunity to introduce key measures outlined by the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness and further act upon the recommendations outlined in the National Housing Accord.   “As Budget 2024 seeks to deliver good jobs for Canadians, address rising affordability challenges, and set the next generation up for success, bold housing policy must be a part of the solution,” said Dr. Mike Moffatt, Founding Director, PLACE Centre at the Smart Prosperity Institute.  On April 16th, we look forward to the release of a budget that delivers the investments needed to fix the housing crisis and end homelessness in Canada.   About the National Housing Accord The National Housing Accord is the outcome of a collaborative effort between experts across the housing continuum to find practicable and implementable solutions to address the housing crisis, and provides ten recommendations for the federal government on how to take a coordinated effort with key stakeholders – including not-for-profits and the private sector – to address housing affordability, meet the needs of Canada’s growing population, create jobs and play a significant role in ending homelessness. Website: www.nationalhousingaccord.ca "},
{"title": "Budget 2024 sets Canada up to solve the housing crisis – now let’s take further steps to solve homelessness", "url": "https://caeh.ca/budget-blog/", "content": "The federal government has set out on a path to solve the housing crisis, with bold investments and ambitious targets outlined in Budget 2024 and their new housing plan. This week’s budget promised $8.5 billion in new spending on housing, complemented by as much as $55 billion in financing – these investments are promising to unlock 3.87 million new homes by 2031.  The impact of the new housing measures should not be underestimated – this is the most ambitious housing plan by the federal government in 50 years and will set Canada up to address the housing crisis over the long-term. We are encouraged by the Government’s adoption of many of the recommendations from the National Housing Accord, which laid out a multi-sector roadmap to solve Canada’s rental housing crisis. The housing plan takes a multi pronged approach to solving the housing crisis, with investments and policies that will incentivize and speed up the construction of both market and non-market housing. New policies such as reforms to tax measures for housing and the availability of low-cost financing were recommended by the Accord and will help put Canada on a path to reaching the 3.5 million homes needed to restore affordability.  The advocacy work of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness and our supporters has kept homelessness on the Government’s agenda. CAEH notes that there are important investments in the Government’s housing plan and in the federal Budget directed at alleviating homelessness over the long-term. The $1 billion investment to stabilize Reaching Home, $250 million for housing-focused responses to encampments and unsheltered homelessness, and $50 million to support communities adopt best practices and accelerate reductions in homelessness will have a tangible impact on community efforts to prevent and end homelessness.  But over the coming months and years, while the new affordable housing gets built, we are particularly worried about the wave of new homelessness growing across the country, and the lack of supports in place to help people experiencing and at-risk of homelessness today. For those at risk of losing their home, direct supports are the most cost-effective way to keep them in their housing and stop them from becoming homeless. A Homelessness Prevention and Housing Benefit would do just that, and is a necessary tool to stop growing homelessness until Canada has fixed the housing crisis and restores affordability for all. Across the country, communities are seeing new homelessness, including among asylum seekers, who are finding themselves in municipal shelter systems in the absence of a comprehensive refugee and asylum seeker resettlement system. The $1.1 billion announced in Budget 2024 to extend the Interim Housing Assistance Program is a necessary measure in addressing this situation, and the federal government must continue to work with all levels of government to quickly deliver the community-driven solutions needed to support the housing needs of asylum seekers.  The federal government has set a clear intention to solve the housing crisis and has created the conditions to address it. Now, with growing rates of homelessness, Canada must also set a clear intention to prevent and end homelessness by developing and implementing a Federal Strategy to End Homelessness. As the federal government seeks to build a fairer Canada for all, it must set out an ambitious plan to end homelessness and deliver the solutions needed to build a housing system that works for everyone.  "},

A Homelessness Prevention and Housing Benefit is an urgently needed tool to help vulnerable renters keep their homes, while we get more affordable homes built. The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness will review the budget in detail and share a detailed analysis in the coming days.  — 30 —About the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness  The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness leads a national movement of individuals, organizations and communities working together to end homelessness in Canada.

{"title": "National Housing Accord Partners Welcome New Federal Housing Plan", "url": "https://caeh.ca/national-housing-accord-partners-welcome-new-federal-housing-plan/", "content": "Ottawa, Ontario (April 12, 2024) – The National Housing Accord authors – the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, REALPAC, and the PLACE Centre at the Smart Prosperity Institute – welcome the release of the federal government’s new housing plan, Solving the Housing Crisis: Canada’s Housing Plan. The plan, announced today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Minister Sean Fraser, is the most comprehensive and ambitious housing strategy by a federal government in over 40 years. We commend the government’s bold vision reflected in this housing plan to make housing affordable for everyone. The plan closely aligns with the National Housing Accord, released in August 2023, which laid out a multi-sector roadmap to solve Canada’s rental housing crisis. The new housing plan, when fully implemented, will have a positive and material impact on the housing crisis by establishing the foundation for further private investment and enabling large-scale construction of new homes. The federal government has already opened up tens of billions of dollars of new housing investment since August 2023, with additional measures expected in Budget 2024 next week.  “This new housing plan will start to get builders building and investors investing,” said Michael Brooks, CEO of REALPAC. “This is the tailwind that both for-profit and non-profit investors and builders needed to begin moving the dial on accelerating construction and affordability in Canada.” “Young Canadians who are struggling to pay their rent or who have given up on the dream of homeownership should find some hope in this budget,” said Mike Moffatt, Founding Director of the PLACE Centre. “The policies introduced today should spur significant growth in construction, making it more affordable to rent or buy a home in the coming years. There is more that the federal government can and should do – but this is a really good start.” “Homelessness is a housing problem and measures introduced today to build more market and affordable rental housing will lead to reduced homelessness in the long term.” said Tim Richter, President and CEO of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. “Extending funding for Reaching Home, dedicated funding to help communities implement housing-focused responses to encampments and unsheltered homelessness, and a new homelessness reduction accelerator fund will go some way to supporting community efforts to prevent and reduce homelessness, but more must be done.” Key next steps to build on today’s announcement include creating a Homelessness Prevention and Housing Benefit to protect vulnerable renters today, expanding investment in social housing, and further changing investment rules to attract the trillions of dollars of private capital required to maximize the potential of this new plan. We look forward to working with the federal government to implement the announced measures and to take further steps towards solving the housing crisis and ending homelessness in Canada.  "}
